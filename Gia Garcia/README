# P1S1 – Part 1 

## What is this?
--------------------
This is the script for **Project 1 – Part 1. 

What it does?
--------------------
- runs the Simulink model a bunch of times with different solvers + time steps
- compares the Simulink result to the theoretical solution
- saves everything and formats it to a table called `T`
- makes a the plots 

## What you need in the folder
--------------------
- `P1S1.m`  (script)
- `P1S1sim.slx` (Simulink)

When you run it, creates:
- `P1_results.mat` (saves the table `T`)

---

## IMPORTANT: Simulink model needs to output
The code assumes the simulation output has this:

- `out.w.time`  : time vector  
- `out.w.data`  : angular speed values

So the Simulink model needs to be logging the signal called `w`

If not loggin, the script will error/crash when it tries to do `out.w.time`.

Quick way to check after one run:
```matlab
out = sim("P1S1sim");
fieldnames(out)
